# R_Exercise-BasicSetup


This project contains sample code to confirm your basic setup of Rstudio and github.

To set up:
* Open RStudio
* Select File → New Project ...
* Choose Version control → Git
* Enter the github repository URL for the project: https://github.com/hyginn/R_Exercise-BasicSetup
* The project name should be entered automatically.
* Browse for the folder in which your project should be installed.
** You should have created a "Workshop" or "Project" folder in which you collect the various modules' "projects".
** Within this folder, create a separate folder for each project before downloading.
** This is the folder which you select.

* Click on Create Project.

The project should now have been created on your computer, i.e. the files should all be located in your project directory, and the R-script "R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R" should be loaded in the left-top pane.

(In case the R script template does not appear in the left-hand pane, click on the file name R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R in the lower-right hand pane.)
