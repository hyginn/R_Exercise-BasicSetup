# R_Exercise-BasicSetup


These are the resources of an **RStudio Project**. You can download and install the project on your own computer to confirm that your installation of **R** and **RStudio** is working, that you have `git` installed and configured, and that you are in good shape to work with whatever material you study in your course or workshop.

To set this up on your own computer: on your computer ...
* Open RStudio
* Select File → New Project ...
* Choose Version control → Git
* Enter the github repository URL for this project: https://github.com/hyginn/R_Exercise-BasicSetup
* The project name should be entered automatically.
* Browse for the folder on your computer in which the project should be installed.
** You should have created a "Workshop" or "Project" folder in which you collect the "modules"' "projects"" for your course or workshop.
** Within this folder, create a separate folder for each project before downloading.
** Select that folder.

* Click on **Create Project**.

The project should now have been created on your computer, i.e. the files should all be located in your project directory, and the R-script `R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R` should be loaded in the left-top pane.

(In case the R script template does not appear in the left-hand pane, click on the file name `R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R` in the lower-right hand pane.)

Contact your instructor in case this does not work, otherwise you won't be able to participate.
