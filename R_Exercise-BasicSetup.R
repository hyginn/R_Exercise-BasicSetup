# == TEST YOUR SETUP ======================================
#

#  BRAVA! You have successfully loaded the project file from GitHub.

# Now go through the tasks below, then return to the Wiki tutorial. But keep
# RStudio open so you can continue to use it in the tutorial.


# ==== Execute some code
#  Execute code by typing <cmd><enter>. When nothing is
#  selected, that will execute the current line and move the cursor to
#  the next line. You can also select more than one line, e.g. to
#  execute a block of code, or less than one line, e.g. to execute
#  only the core of a nested expression.




# ==== Load a package


# ==== Change some code and save the change


# ==== Quit, and restart where you left off




# [END]
