#  BRAVA! You have successfully loaded the project file from GitHub.

# Now go through the tasks below.

# =    1  The RStudio layout  ==================================================

# In the default layout of RStudio's panes, this script file has been opened in
# the top-left pane; I refer to this as the "Script Pane". This is where you
# read and edit files.

# The pane below (bottom-left) is the "Console". This is where you type
# commands, or execute them from a script. This is also where RStudio produces
# its output.

# The pane at the top-right is the "Environment Pane". This is where you can see
# which variables or functions have currently been defined ("assigned") and what
# their values are.

# The pane at the bottom-right displays different kinds of information in its
# tabs: In the "Files Tab" you see a directory listing of the contents of the
# current working directory. The "Plots Tab" shows plots and graphs that R has
# created. And the "Help Tab" displays the information in R's help system.

# =    2  Executing code  ======================================================
#
#  You can execute code by typing it into the console.
#  Type: 3 + 4  and then hit <enter>
#
#  Now type: 1 + sqrt(5) / 2
#  (This is NOT the Golden Ratio, phi)
#
# ==   2.1  Up-arrow recalls previous commands  ================================
#
#  To change this to the formula for the Golden Ratio, you need to use
#  parentheses to enforce the proper operator precedence. Use the up-arrow key
#  to get the expression back on the command-line, then use the left and right
#  arrow keys to edit the expression and enter the correct parentheses: the
#  expression should read (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
#  Then press <enter> to execute the corrected expression.
#  R should respond with
#       [1] 1.618034
#

# ==   2.2  History tab  =======================================================
# Another way to access previously typed code is through the History tab in the
# upper-right pane. Scroll to find a line that you want to execute or edit,
# double-click it, and it will appear in the Console. Try this.

# ==   2.3  Command-specific history  ==========================================
# Even more convenient is to type a few characters of a previous command, then
# hit <cmd><up-arrow>. A little window with previous commands that begin with
# the characters you just typed pops up and if you select one and hit <enter>,
# it gets loaded into the command line and you can either hit enter to execute
# it again, or edit it. This won't make a lot of sense now because you haven't
# entered many commands yet - it will be quite useful later.

# ==   2.4  Cmd-Enter to execute selected code  ================================

# You can ALSO execute code by selecting code in the Script Pane (where you are
# readinf right now) and pressing <command><enter> (or <ctrl><enter> on
# Windows). This passes code from the Script Pane to the console and executes it
# automatically. This is very convenient - in fact, this is the preferred way to
# work with lengthy scripts. Try this immediately: place the cursor anywhere
# into the expression below and type <command><enter>:


cat("\n  /\\_/\\\n ( o.o )\n  > ^ <\n\n")


# (No, the function cat() is not specifically meant to draw images of cats!
# Its name comes from conCATenate.)


# There are several variants to selecting and executing code. Read this
# carefully and try the alternatives - these three crazy tricks will change your
# life:

#  - When nothing is selected in the Script Pane, pressing <command><enter> will
#    execute the current line and move the cursor to the next line. You can
#    "walk" through code line by line in this way.
#
#  - This is the same as if you would have selected an entire line.

#  - If you select more than one line, you can execute an entire block of code
#    at once. Try this: select the block of code below, (from the first
#    assignment of FibPrev to the print() statement) and hit <command><enter>
#    to execute it. The code calculates successive approximations of the Golden
#    Ratio from Fibonacci numbers, and then prints the "true" value.

FibPrev <- 1L    # assign integer 1
FibCurr <- 1L
for (i in 1:40) {
    print(FibCurr / FibPrev, digits = 22) # approximate phi as the ratio of
                                          # two successive Fibonacci numbers
    tmp <- FibCurr
    FibCurr <- FibPrev + FibCurr          # calculate the next Fibonacci number
    FibPrev <- tmp                        # swap
}
print((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, digits = 22)     # the real Golden Ratio for comparison
print(FibCurr)                            # the Fib_40 is pretty large

# Nb. This is a slow algorithm - it adds about a digit of accuracy every 3.5
# iterations. While we're here, let's play a bit: Here is a MUCH faster
# algorithm, based on the following identities:
#    Given F[k] and F[k + 1]:
#        F_2k   == F_k * ((2 * F_k+1) - F_k)
#        F_2k+1 == F_k^2 + F_k+1^2

FibPrev <- 1L    # assign integer 1
FibCurr <- 1L
for (i in 1:7) {
    print(FibCurr / FibPrev, digits = 22) # approximate phi as the ratio of
    # two successive Fibonacci numbers
    Fk  <- FibPrev
    Fk1 <- FibCurr
    FibPrev <- Fk * ((2 * Fk1) - Fk)  # calculate F_2k
    FibCurr <- Fk^2 + Fk1^2           # calculate F_2k+1
}
print((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, digits = 22)   # The real Golden Ratio (approximately)
print(FibCurr)                          # Huge number, efficiently found


# This is just playing with numbers (i) for you to practice reading code, (ii)
# experimenting with alternatives (for example you could install the Rmpfr
# package for arbitrarily accurate computations, and calculate phi to 100 digits
# accuracy), and (iii) understand that efficient algorithms can be _very_ much
# faster than naive approaches to calculate. Often, whether something can be
# practically calculated at all depends on whether you can approach the problem
# in a way that it maps to a problem for which an efficient algorithm is
# available.


# ==   2.5  Analyzing expressions inside-out  ==================================

# Selecting and executing code is also really useful to analyze complex, nested
# R expressions from the inside out. To do this, you select _less_ than
# one line of code.

# Here's an example: assume you would like to try an intermittent fasting
# regime, fasting every fifth day, starting tomorrow. What will the next five
# weekdays of fasting be?

format(Sys.Date() + 1 + seq(0, length.out = 5, by = 5), "%a")

# That seems to be the correct result, but how on earth does this work?
# To understand this, we analyze the components of this expression. First
# select  Sys.Date() and execute it. You should get today's date.
#
# Next select Sys.Date() + 1 and execute that. This should give you
# tomorrow's date.
#
# Next select seq(0, length.out = 5, by = 5) and execute it. You should get
# [1]  0  5 10 15 20 ... i.e a vector of numbers, starting from 1, 5 numbers
#                            in all, each incremented by 5.
#
# What do we get when we add one to this vector? Select
# 1 + seq(0, length.out = 5, by = 5)
# and execute it to find out.
#
# And what do we get when we add a date to this resulting vector? Select
# Sys.Date() + 1 + seq(0, length.out = 5, by = 5)
# and execute it. These are the next five fasting days.

# And finally, what weekdays are these? format() is a versatile function that
# can handle many different types of R objects. We call this a "generic"
# function. If the object is of class "Date", the function sends the data to the
# format.Date() function, which knows how to convert this into weekdays (see
# ?strptime for a complete list of format options).

# Get into the habit to decompose R expressions and analyze what the individual
# components do, how they are nested, and how they work together. This is what
# reading code is about. If you just gloss over such complicated expressions
# you won't learn.

# I don't always write code in such nested ways for two reasons: (1) its
# not always obvious what happens, and code MUST be obvious or it is bad code;
# and (2) this is hard to debug if something goes wrong. Thus for course code
# I tend more often to write the same thing as:

x <- Sys.Date() + 1
x <- x + seq(0, length.out = 5, by = 5)
format(x, "%a")

# In this case we can watch how x changes line by line in the Environment
# Pane (top right) and check that what we do is correct.
#
#    N.b. Some people advocate using the pipe operator "%>%" from the magrittr::
#    package (also part of the "tidyverse"). And they often write very
#    enthusiastically about its benefits. After many years of considering it
#    I still think this is a poor idea. If you like, we can discuss this at some
#    point. But the idiom of using intermediate assignments to some variable
#    x or similar is what you will encounter most frequently in this course.

# =    3  Files, and the working directory  ====================================

# We need to make sure the working directory is set correctly. Execute
list.files()
# ... to get a list of files in the current working directory.
# If this is not the list of files you see in RStudio's  Files Pane, execute
getwd()
# ... to see what the working directory is set to. Then use the menu:
# Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Project Directory
# This executes the correct setwd() command. Confirm by executing
list.files()
# ... again.
#

# =    4  Change some code and save the change  ================================

# Here is a bit of code that plots 1.5 turns of the Golden Spiral. Don't worry
# if you don't understand the details - that's not the point right now. Execute
# the code.

turns <- 1.5                                 # number of turns to plot
p <- seq(0, (turns * 2 * pi),
         length.out = round(turns * 100))    # intervals, in radians
plot(exp(0.3061868562 * p) * cos(p),         # x-coordinates
     exp(0.3061868562 * p) * sin(p),         # y-coordinates
     type = "l", col = "#CC0000",            # draw as a red line
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",                 # turn tick-marks off
     xlab = "", ylab = "",                   # turn axis labels off
     asp = 1.0)                              # plot with 1:1 aspect ratio
abline(v = 0, col = "#E6EEFF")               # add pale-blue vertical ...
abline(h = 0, col = "#E6EEFF")               # ... and horizontal line

# Now change the value of "turns" from 1.5 to 2.75 in the code above. Note that
# the filename in the Script Pane changes colour: it turns red and has a star
# behind it. This means: this script has unsaved changes.

# Execute the modified block of code. The number of the turns increases.

# Now save the change. The filename changes to black again. The Modified date
# of the script in the Files Pane is now today's date.


# =    5  Quit, and restart where you left off  ================================

# Finally, we'll quit RStudio and restart the project. It should be obvious how
# to quit. But here's how to reload a project.

# Choose: File -> Recent Projects -> <the project you need>

# Note: Take care to choose the "Recent Projects" menu option,
#       not "Recent Files".

# Try this out, use the File -> Quit Session... option to quit - and if you are
# being asked if you want to save anything, for the purpose of this course or
# workshop _always_ answer "No". Then reload the project, note that the value of
# turns should now be what you had changed it to.

# Plot another beautiful spiral for good measure.


# =    6  Shortcuts and autocomplete  ==========================================

# RStudio's editor has a number of useful shortcuts and aids for efficient
# coding. Try them.
#
#   - Typing an opening parenthesis automatically types the closing parenthesis.
#
#   - Selecting text and typing a quotation mark quotes the selected text.
#
#   - Both bracketing and quoting of selected code work with single- and
#     double quotation marks, parentheses, square brackets and curly braces.
#
#   - Typing a newline character automatically indents the following line.
#
#   - Typing a newline inside a comment automatically prefixes the line
#     with a comment character.
#
#   - Typing the first three letters of a variable or function name lists
#     possible choices to autocomplete. Use the arrow keys to select, hit
#     <enter> or <tab> to execute. Note that this is not case sensitive.
#     Autocomplete is therefore especially useful if you are not sure about
#     the correct case. Try it: type  Tur  and you should get the variable
#     "turns" selected.
#
#   - typing <alt>-<up-arrow> shifts a line (or selected block) up or down.
#     (I use this a lot :-)
#
#   - holding <alt> while selecting things allows you to select columns.
#     Try this: in the block below select and delete the extra two
#     columns of sevens:
#
#     012345677789
#     012345677789
#     012345677789
#
#   - note how the insert cursor spans all three lines. You can also use this
#     to type into several lines at once! Try this: place the cursor behind the
#     three nines, then type abcdef. Hex.
#
#   - You can customize the keyboard layout and this makes it easy to switch
#     between programs that you are used to without having to remember new
#     every shortcuts every time. One thing I always change in my work is
#     the code to move between open tabs (I usually have quite a few open).
#     For Chrome, on the Mac the code is Alt+Cmd+Left resp. Alt+Cmd+Right to
#     step forward resp. backwards through tabs. On Chrome for Windows it
#     is Ctrl+PgDown resp. Ctrl+PgUp. The RStudio default is Ctrl+Tab resp.
#     Ctrl+Shift+Tab.
#
#     Task:
#     =====
#     Open Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...
#     Type  tab  into the Filter box.
#     Find "Open Next Tab" and "Open Previous Tab".
#     Click on the current key combination to edit it.
#     Press the same keycode that works for Chrome on your computer.
#     Click apply to save your choices.
#
#     Now open a few files from the  Files  pane and confirm that the
#     new key combo works for you, forward and back.
#
#  -  Sometimes we want to compare files with each other, and switching tabs
#     is not so convenient. You should know that you can undock tabs too, by
#     dragging them out of the main RStudio window. That's very useful. Try
#     it!
